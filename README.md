# Xamarin.Firebase.iOS
[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) bindings for Xamarin.iOS

In order to use the new Firebase from Google we have to get some bindings for Xamarin apps, right?

We know Xamarin is working on them (see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37420600/can-should-i-use-firebase-with-ionic-2-or-xamarin), [here](https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/67822/support-for-google-firebase) and [here](https://github.com/SotoiGhost/GoogleApisForiOSComponents/tree/firebase)) but it's taking longer than it should.

So here is a repo everyone can collaborate and grow the Firebase for Xamarin.iOS apps.

Firebase for Xamarin.Android is already available in Nuget. Read more [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Xamarin.Firebase).


## Contributing
Appreciate any feedback on the bindings and how to make them better.


## What's in there
1. [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/)
2. [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) (Google Sign In)
and a sample app.

## Running the sample.
Please create an app in the Firebase console, download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and put it in the project. And enable Google Accounts sign in.
